		On this page, you’ll find data which we have extracted from our course creation and learning platform. In this release (which will be the first of several) you’ll find data about courses, data about comments made on courses and data about how content was created in courses.
        </h4>
	<h4 class="span12 index-intro">
		All the data that you’ll find here is publicly available on our site, if you were dedicated enough, you could scrape it all. But we’ve left our sensitive information like people’s email addresses, IP addresses and password hashes. 
        </h4>
	<h4 class="span12 index-intro">
		Everything P2PU does is guided by our core values of openness, community and peer learning, so it made sense to us to open up our data, and share it with our community in a format that allows anyone to use it for their own learning and exploration. 
        </h4>
	<h4 class="span12 index-intro">
		None of this data would be in a state which makes any sense if it weren’t for June Ahn and Sarah Jane Webster, our fantastic collaborators from the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the College of Information Studies,  University of Maryland, Collge Park. June and Sarah are investigating how online cyberinfrastructure can be designed, implemented, and analyzed to foster educational experiences at a massive scale. They have identified the datasets, cleaned up the data, advised us on building the whitelist and generally been patient and amazing. Thank you.
