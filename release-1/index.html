            <p><strong>P2PU has always believed in experimentation, and that the results of our experiments should be
                shared. One of these areas of experimentation is our work set-up - we are a totally virtual, distributed
                non-profit, with staff and volunteers all over the world.</strong></p>

            <p>In 2012, we decided to try running a pop-up office for 1 month. This report documents the set-up,
                experience and evaluation of the pop-up. Distributed working is becoming increasingly popular,
                particularly in the non-profit and tech worlds, where staff with expertise may be located in several
                countries. While this model has many benefits, it also present a unique set of challenges. It is our
                hope that this report provides useful guidelines for other virtual organisations who might want to run
                short-term offices, and a face-to-face model for other global, distributed communities.</p>

            <p>When planning the Berlin Office, we looked online for advice and guidelines on how to run a project like
                this, which we conceptualised of as part event, part conference, part residency. We struggled to find
                any resources which were applicable to our experience, so we created this document, as both a record of
                how we went about planning and running the office, and as a tool for other communities and organisations
                who might be grappling with the same questions.</p>

            <p>We're not looking to influence anyone, and we're sure that other people might take a look at how we did
                things and decide to do it differently. In fact, we'd be delighted to hear from anyone who has modified
                our process â€“ we hope it can be a useful starting point and would love to see where you ended up.</p>
