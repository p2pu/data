            <p>This is the first data release from P2PU. As part of our philosophy of openness and sharing we are releasing the data from the courses that are on <a href="https://p2pu.org">P2PU.org</a>.</p>
            <p>You can get the data by downloading <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/release-1/data.zip">this zip file</a>. Inside you will find the data in CSV files and the data dictionary that describes the data.</p>
            <p>You can use this data in all sorts of ways. You might simply want to analyse patterns over time, or compare two or more different learning experiments. Technical users might want to create applications out of the raw data files, which can then be used by everyone. How you use the data is completely up to you. The only thing we ask is that you stick to the conditions of the licence, as outlined below. Happy data wrangling!</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about this data, don't hesitate to ask us on our <a href="http://thepeople.p2pu.org/">Discourse forum</a></p>
            <p>This data is licenced with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0</a> licence. Simply put, you are welcome to use this data for your own work, but you have to credit us when you do so.</p>
